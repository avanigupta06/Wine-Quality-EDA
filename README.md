# 🍷 Wine-Quality-EDA

This project performs **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the Red Wine Quality dataset available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to analyze the chemical properties of wine and understand how they influence wine quality ratings.

## 📂 Dataset Information

- **Type**: Red Wine ("Vinho Verde")  
- **Instances**: 1,599  
- **Features**: 11 input variables (physicochemical tests) + 1 output variable (quality score)

## 🔍 EDA Highlights

- **Initial Data Inspection**:
  - Loaded the dataset using `pandas`
  - Checked for null values and data types
  - Removed duplicate rows for cleaner analysis

- **Quality Distribution**:
  - Imbalanced dataset with most wines rated 5 or 6

- **Correlation Analysis**:
  - Used heatmap to visualize correlation matrix
  - Found strong positive correlation between **alcohol** and **quality**

- **Visual Explorations**:
  - Histograms and KDE plots for univariate analysis
  - Boxplots and scatter plots for bivariate analysis
  - Pairplots for multivariate relationships
  - Categorical plots showing alcohol levels across quality ratings

## 📊 Key Takeaways

- Wines with higher **alcohol content** tend to have higher quality scores.
- **Volatile acidity** is negatively correlated with quality.
- Dataset is suitable for both classification and regression modeling.
